Loan Approval Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the loan approval status of applicants based on their demographic and financial details.
The model helps financial institutions automate and streamline the loan approval process, reducing manual intervention and decision-making time.

Dataset Details
Dataset: Loan Approval Dataset (614 rows, 13 columns)
Target Variable: Loan_Status (1: Approved, 0: Not Approved)
Features: Applicant income, credit history, marital status, property area, etc.


Detailed Explanation of Each Step:
Importing Libraries: We import the necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and others for model training and evaluation.

Loading the Datasets: The training and test datasets are loaded from CSV files (train_data.csv and test_data.csv).

EDA - Data Overview: We check the data types and the first few rows of both the training and test datasets to understand the structure.

Missing Values: We inspect missing values in both training and test datasets. We handle missing values using SimpleImputer (for numerical and categorical columns).

Handling Missing Data:

For numerical columns, we replace missing values with the median.
For categorical columns, we replace missing values with the most frequent value.
Descriptive Statistics: Basic summary statistics are shown for numerical columns (mean, min, max, etc.).

Categorical Data Encoding: We use LabelEncoder to convert categorical variables into numerical format for use in the model.

Dropping Unnecessary Columns: We drop the Loan_ID column since itâ€™s not useful for prediction.

Feature and Target Separation: We separate the features (X_train and X_test) and target variable (y_train and y_test).

Training the Model: We train a RandomForestClassifier on the training dataset (X_train and y_train).

Making Predictions: We use the trained model to predict the loan approval status on the test data (X_test).

Model Evaluation:

We print the accuracy of the model on the test dataset.
We generate a classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
We display the confusion matrix to evaluate how well the model performed in predicting both classes (approved or not).
Feature Importance: We print the importance of each feature in making predictions, which helps in understanding which factors are most influential.

Saving the Model: The trained model is saved using joblib.dump(), so you can load and use it later for predictions on new data.

Future Enhancements
Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.
Explore advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
Add additional features for improved model performance.
